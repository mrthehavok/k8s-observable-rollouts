## Description

Configure Argo Rollouts to manage progressive delivery of the sample-api service. Implement canary and blue-green rollout strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Argo Rollouts controller deployed and operational.
- [ ] `Rollout` resource defined for the sample-api service.
- [ ] Canary strategy configured with traffic splitting.
- [ ] Blue-green strategy configured with a preview service.
- [ ] Integration with the ingress controller for traffic management.
- [ ] Basic rollback and promotion policies are configured.
- [ ] Rollout dashboard is accessible for monitoring.

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Define rollout strategies in separate YAML files
- Configure traffic management with NGINX ingress
- Set up webhook notifications for rollout events
- Create reusable templates for common patterns

## Notes

- Use Rollout resource instead of Deployment in Helm chart
- Consider using Istio for more advanced traffic management
- Document rollback procedures and emergency protocols
- Test all strategies in dev environment first
- Ensure compatibility with HPA and pod disruption budgets
