## Description

Configure Argo Rollouts to manage progressive delivery of the sample-api service. Implement multiple rollout strategies including canary, blue-green, and experiment-based deployments. Integrate with the Helm chart to support seamless transitions between deployment methods.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Argo Rollouts controller deployed and operational
- [ ] Rollout resource defined for sample-api service
- [ ] Canary strategy configured with traffic splitting
- [ ] Blue-green strategy configured with preview service
- [ ] Experiment strategy configured for A/B testing
- [ ] Integration with ingress controller for traffic management
- [ ] Rollback triggers and thresholds defined
- [ ] Promotion policies (manual/automatic) configured
- [ ] Dashboard access configured for monitoring rollouts

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Define rollout strategies in separate YAML files
- Configure traffic management with NGINX ingress
- Set up webhook notifications for rollout events
- Create reusable templates for common patterns

## Notes

- Use Rollout resource instead of Deployment in Helm chart
- Consider using Istio for more advanced traffic management
- Document rollback procedures and emergency protocols
- Test all strategies in dev environment first
- Ensure compatibility with HPA and pod disruption budgets
