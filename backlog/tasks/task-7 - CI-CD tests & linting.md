## Description

Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline should run on pull requests to lint and test the application and Helm chart.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is created.
- [ ] Pipeline is triggered on pull requests to the main branch.
- [ ] A linting job runs for the FastAPI application code.
- [ ] A testing job runs the `pytest` suite for the application.
- [ ] A `helm lint` job runs for the Helm chart.
- [ ] The pipeline status (pass/fail) is reported on the pull request.

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Configure the CI pipeline.
- Add jobs for linting and testing.

## Notes

- This pipeline is for CI (Continuous Integration) only. CD (Continuous Deployment) is handled by Argo CD.
- The pipeline should not build or push container images.
