## Description

Create GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment. Implement automated builds, testing, security scanning, and GitOps-based deployments. Workflows should support the progressive delivery patterns configured with Argo Rollouts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI workflow for code quality and unit tests
- [ ] Docker image build and push to registry
- [ ] Security scanning (SAST, dependency check, container scan)
- [ ] Integration test execution in ephemeral environment
- [ ] Automated version tagging and release notes
- [ ] GitOps deployment via Argo CD webhook
- [ ] Multi-environment promotion workflow
- [ ] Rollback workflow for emergency scenarios
- [ ] Build artifacts and test reports archived

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Set up GitHub repository secrets
- Configure container registry access
- Design branch protection rules
- Create reusable workflow templates

## Notes

- Use matrix builds for multiple Python versions
- Implement caching for dependencies and Docker layers
- Consider using GitHub Environments for approvals
- Integrate with GitHub Dependabot
- Use semantic versioning for releases
