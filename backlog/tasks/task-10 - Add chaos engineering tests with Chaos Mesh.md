## Description

Implement chaos engineering practices using Chaos Mesh to test the resilience of the progressive delivery setup. Create chaos experiments that validate the behavior of Argo Rollouts under various failure scenarios, ensuring automatic rollbacks work correctly when issues are detected.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chaos Mesh deployed and configured in cluster
- [ ] Pod failure experiments for sample-api
- [ ] Network chaos experiments (latency, packet loss)
- [ ] Stress experiments (CPU, memory pressure)
- [ ] Experiments integrated with Rollout analysis
- [ ] Automated chaos test scenarios defined
- [ ] Observability for chaos experiments configured
- [ ] Documentation of failure scenarios and expected behaviors
- [ ] Recovery time objectives (RTO) validated

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Design chaos experiment scenarios
- Create experiment templates for reuse
- Define success criteria for each experiment
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Notes

- Start with simple experiments and gradually increase complexity
- Ensure experiments are contained to avoid cluster-wide impact
- Monitor resource usage during chaos experiments
- Create runbooks for each failure scenario
- Consider using Litmus as an alternative chaos framework
