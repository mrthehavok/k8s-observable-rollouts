## Description

Deploy Argo CD to the Minikube cluster using the App-of-Apps pattern. Configure Argo CD to manage itself and all other applications in the cluster through GitOps practices. Set up the root application that will manage all child applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Argo CD deployed in dedicated `argocd` namespace
- [x] Root application configured pointing to `argocd-apps/` directory
- [x] App-of-Apps pattern implemented with proper YAML structure
- [x] Argo CD UI accessible via port-forward or ingress
- [x] Admin credentials configured and documented
- [x] Self-management enabled (Argo CD manages its own configuration)
- [x] GitHub repository connected as application source
- [x] Sync policies configured for automatic synchronization
