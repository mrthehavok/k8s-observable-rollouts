## Description

Deploy Argo CD to the Minikube cluster using the App-of-Apps pattern. Configure Argo CD to manage itself and all other applications in the cluster through GitOps practices. Set up the root application that will manage all child applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Argo CD deployed in dedicated `argocd` namespace
- [ ] Root application configured pointing to `argocd-apps/` directory
- [ ] App-of-Apps pattern implemented with proper YAML structure
- [ ] Argo CD UI accessible via port-forward or ingress
- [ ] Admin credentials configured and documented
- [ ] Self-management enabled (Argo CD manages its own configuration)
- [ ] GitHub repository connected as application source
- [ ] Sync policies configured for automatic synchronization

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Create argocd-apps/ directory structure
- Define root application manifest
- Configure repository credentials
- Set up webhook for automatic sync (optional)

## Notes

- Use declarative setup to ensure reproducibility
- Consider enabling SSO for production use
- Document any custom configurations or patches applied
- May need to configure resource limits for Argo CD components
