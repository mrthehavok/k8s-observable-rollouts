title: "Integrate context7 MCP configuration and repository conformance"
status: "In Progress"

## Description

Integrate context7 MCP configuration per project standards in [`05_MCP.md`](../../05_MCP.md). Create a comprehensive [`context7.json`](../../context7.json) at repository root with proper schema validation, conduct repository audit for conformance, and implement remediations to ensure all code and documentation aligns with the configuration.

This task establishes the foundation for context7 MCP integration and ensures repository consistency with defined project structure and rules. All work will be completed in a new feature branch following PR-\* workflow standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [`context7.json`](../../context7.json) exists at repo root with required keys populated:
  - $schema
  - projectTitle
  - description
  - folders (enumerate major project directories)
  - excludeFolders (empty initially)
  - excludeFiles (empty initially)
  - rules (alignment rules for audit/remediation)
  - previousVersions (empty array)
- [ ] New branch feat/task-11-context7-integration created for all changes
- [ ] File format validation completed (lint/parse, basic key checks)
- [ ] Audit report created at [`.audit/2025/08/context7-audit.md`](../../.audit/2025/08/context7-audit.md) with findings and remediations
- [ ] No references to outdated or conflicting config remain in code or docs
- [ ] All changes committed and Draft PR created referencing task-11
- [ ] Backlog task updated to "Done" after PR merge (PR-\* compliance)

## Session History

- 2025-08-21 10:43: Task created in Orchestrator mode, delegated to Architect mode
- 2025-08-21 10:52: Switched to Code mode for implementation

## Decisions Made

- Initial rules defined to guide audit and remediation:
  - All documentation must align with context7.json values (title, description, folders)
  - Do not reference deprecated paths or modules removed from context7.json
  - Prefer YAML comments with # and avoid outdated HEREDOCs where jsonencode/yamlencode fits (TF-FR standards)
  - No secrets committed; adhere to SP-\* rules; update .gitignore if needed
  - If MCP tools are added/changed, update context7.json accordingly (MCP-01, MCP-03)
  - Store audit and decision logs under /.audit/YYYY/MM per AR-02

## Files Modified

Expected files to be created/modified:

- [`context7.json`](../../context7.json) (new)
- [`.gitignore`](../../.gitignore) (potentially updated per MCP-01)
- Documentation files (potentially updated for consistency)
- This task file (status updates)

## Blockers

None currently identified.

## Next Steps

1. Update task status to "In Progress"
2. Create feature branch feat/task-11-context7-integration
3. Create [`context7.json`](../../context7.json) with required schema and content
4. Validate file format and structure
5. Conduct repository audit and generate report
6. Apply remediations for consistency
7. Commit changes and create Draft PR

## Notes

- Following MCP standards from [`05_MCP.md`](../../05_MCP.md) for context7 integration
- Adhering to task management workflow from [`02_task_management.md`](../../02_task_management.md)
- PR workflow follows standards from [`03_pull_request_workflow.md`](../../03_pull_request_workflow.md)
- Security and archival per SP-_ and AR-_ rules in [`00_core_principles.md`](../../00_core_principles.md)
