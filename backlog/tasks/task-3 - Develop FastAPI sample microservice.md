## Description

Develop a sample FastAPI microservice that will serve as the target application for demonstrating progressive delivery with Argo Rollouts. The service should include health endpoints, metrics exposure, and feature flags to simulate different versions during rollouts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FastAPI application with REST endpoints implemented
- [ ] Health check endpoints (/health, /ready) configured
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint exposed
- [ ] Version endpoint returning current application version
- [ ] Feature flag endpoint to simulate different behaviors
- [ ] Unit tests with â‰¥80% coverage
- [ ] Dockerfile optimized for production use
- [ ] Configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
