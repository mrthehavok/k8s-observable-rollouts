## Description

Install and configure a local Minikube cluster for development and testing. This cluster will serve as the foundation for deploying all Kubernetes components including Argo CD, Argo Rollouts, observability tools, and the sample application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Minikube installed with recommended version (≥1.32.0)
- [x] Cluster configured with sufficient resources (≥4 CPUs, ≥8GB RAM)
- [x] kubectl configured and connected to Minikube cluster
- [x] Ingress addon enabled for external access
- [x] DNS addon enabled for service discovery
- [x] Metrics-server addon enabled for resource monitoring
- [x] Cluster stability verified with basic smoke tests

## Session History

- 2025-08-06T16:17:23Z: Started work on task.
- 2025-08-06T16:20:58Z: Verified cluster is running and all addons are operational.
- 2025-08-06T16:06:25Z: Agent started work on local Minikube setup.

## Decisions Made

- Used the Docker driver for Minikube for better performance and compatibility.
- Allocated 4 CPUs and 8GB of RAM to ensure sufficient resources for the full stack.
- Enabled `ingress`, `dns`, and `metrics-server` addons by default to support the project's requirements.

## Files Modified

- `scripts/setup_minikube.sh` (created)
- `docs/infrastructure-setup.md` (modified)

## Blockers

- None.

## Next Steps

- The next step is to proceed with `task-2`, which involves deploying Argo CD to the newly created cluster.

## Notes

- The setup script provides a reproducible way to create the local cluster.
- The cluster is now ready for the deployment of the application stack.
