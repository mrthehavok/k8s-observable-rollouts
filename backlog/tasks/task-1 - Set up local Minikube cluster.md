## Description

Install and configure a local Minikube cluster for development and testing. This cluster will serve as the foundation for deploying all Kubernetes components including Argo CD, Argo Rollouts, observability tools, and the sample application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Minikube installed with recommended version (≥1.32.0)
- [ ] Cluster configured with sufficient resources (≥4 CPUs, ≥8GB RAM)
- [ ] kubectl configured and connected to Minikube cluster
- [ ] Ingress addon enabled for external access
- [ ] DNS addon enabled for service discovery
- [ ] Metrics-server addon enabled for resource monitoring
- [ ] Cluster stability verified with basic smoke tests

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Determine optimal Minikube driver (Docker, KVM2, VirtualBox)
- Configure resource allocation based on system capabilities
- Create setup script for reproducible installation

## Notes

- Consider using Docker driver for better performance on Linux/Mac
- May need to adjust resource allocation based on available system resources
- Enable feature gates for beta features if needed for Argo Rollouts
