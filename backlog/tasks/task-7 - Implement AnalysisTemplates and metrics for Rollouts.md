## Description

Create AnalysisTemplates that define automated quality gates for Argo Rollouts. Configure metrics providers to query Prometheus for application performance indicators. Implement analysis runs that automatically promote or abort rollouts based on real-time metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AnalysisTemplate for latency metrics (P95, P99)
- [ ] AnalysisTemplate for error rate thresholds
- [ ] AnalysisTemplate for custom business metrics
- [ ] Prometheus provider configured in Rollouts
- [ ] Success/failure criteria with appropriate thresholds
- [ ] Background analysis during canary deployments
- [ ] Post-promotion analysis configured
- [ ] Integration with rollback automation
- [ ] Documentation of all metrics and thresholds

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Define SLI metrics for the sample application
- Create reusable AnalysisTemplate library
- Test failure scenarios and rollback behavior
- Document metric calculation formulas

## Notes

- Use PromQL for complex metric queries
- Consider using multiple metrics for robust decisions
- Set conservative thresholds initially
- Include comparison against baseline/stable version
- Test with synthetic load to validate thresholds
