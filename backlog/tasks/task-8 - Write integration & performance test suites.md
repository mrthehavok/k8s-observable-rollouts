## Description

Develop comprehensive integration and performance test suites for the sample-api service. Tests should validate functionality across different deployment scenarios, measure performance baselines, and integrate with the CI/CD pipeline to gate deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration test suite with API endpoint coverage
- [ ] Load testing scenarios using k6 or similar tool
- [ ] Performance baseline metrics established
- [ ] Tests executable in Kubernetes environment
- [ ] Smoke tests for post-deployment validation
- [ ] Contract tests for API compatibility
- [ ] Test reports integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance regression detection implemented
- [ ] Documentation of test scenarios and thresholds

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Select appropriate testing tools and frameworks
- Define test data management strategy
- Create reusable test fixtures and utilities
- Establish performance benchmarks

## Notes

- Consider using pytest for integration tests
- k6 recommended for load testing with Prometheus integration
- Tests should run in isolated namespaces
- Include tests for rollback scenarios
- Implement test parallelization for faster feedback
