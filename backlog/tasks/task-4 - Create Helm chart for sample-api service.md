## Description

Create a production-ready Helm chart for the FastAPI sample microservice. The chart should follow Helm best practices, support multiple deployment environments, and integrate seamlessly with Argo CD and Argo Rollouts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Helm chart structure follows official best practices
- [ ] Values files for dev, staging, and prod environments
- [ ] Deployment manifest with proper resource limits/requests
- [ ] Service manifest with appropriate type and ports
- [ ] ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration
- [ ] Secret management strategy documented
- [ ] HorizontalPodAutoscaler configured
- [ ] NetworkPolicy for security
- [ ] Chart tested with helm lint and helm test
- [ ] README.md with comprehensive documentation

## Session History

<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Decisions Made

<!-- Document key implementation decisions -->

## Files Modified

<!-- Track all file changes -->

## Blockers

<!-- Document any blockers encountered -->

## Next Steps

- Define chart metadata and dependencies
- Create templates for all Kubernetes resources
- Implement value validation using JSON schema
- Add helm hooks for pre/post deployment tasks

## Notes

- Use Helm 3.x features exclusively
- Consider using library charts for common patterns
- Implement proper RBAC if service needs cluster access
- Ensure chart supports both Deployment and Rollout resources
- Follow semantic versioning for chart versions
